**Status.** Proposal stage (no code)

This repository is to provide a general purpose interface. It is designed based on
experiences of developers of MLJ's [MLJModelInterface.jl]() which it will eventually
replace, but hopes to be useful more generally. The design is in a state of flux and
comments (posted as issues) are welcome.
