**Status.** Proposal, unregistered. 

This repository is to provide a general purpose machine learning interface. It is designed
based on experiences of developers of MLJ's [MLJModelInterface.jl]() which it will
eventually replace, but hopes to be useful more generally. The design is not yet fixed and
comments (posted as issues) are welcome.

To get an idea of the kinds of models we are aiming to indclude, see [Common Implementation
Patterns]().
