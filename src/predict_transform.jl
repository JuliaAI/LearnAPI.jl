    ## Assumptions about data

    By default, it is assumed that `data` supports the [`LearnAPI.RandomAccess`](@ref)
    interface; this includes all matrices, with observations-as-columns, most tables, and
    tuples thereof). See [`LearnAPI.RandomAccess`](@ref) for details. If this is not the
    case then an implementation must either: (i) overload [`obs`](@ref) to articulate how
    provided data can be transformed into a form that does support
    [`LearnAPI.RandomAccess`](@ref); or (ii) overload the trait
    [`LearnAPI.data_interface`](@ref) to specify a more relaxed data API. Refer to
    document strings for details.

"""
    predict(model, kind_of_proxy::LearnAPI.KindOfProxy, data)
    predict(model, data)

The first signature returns target predictions, or proxies for target predictions, for
input features `data`, according to some `model` returned by [`fit`](@ref). Where
supported, these are literally target predictions if `kind_of_proxy = Point()`,
and probability density/mass functions if `kind_of_proxy = Distribution()`. List all
options with [`LearnAPI.kinds_of_proxy(algorithm)`](@ref), where `algorithm =
LearnAPI.algorithm(model)`.

The shortcut `predict(model, data)` calls the first method with an algorithm-specific
`kind_of_proxy`, namely the first element of [`LearnAPI.kinds_of_proxy(algorithm)`](@ref),
which lists all supported target proxies.

The argument `model` is anything returned by a call of the form `fit(algorithm, ...)`.

If `LearnAPI.features(LearnAPI.algorithm(model)) == nothing`, then argument `data` is
omitted in both signatures. An example is density estimators.

# Example

In the following, `algorithm` is some supervised learning algorithm with
training features `X`, training target `y`, and test features `Xnew`:

```julia
model = fit(algorithm, (X, y)) # or `fit(algorithm, X, y)`
predict(model, Point(), Xnew)
```

See also [`fit`](@ref), [`transform`](@ref), [`inverse_transform`](@ref).

# Extended help

Note `predict ` must not mutate any argument, except in the special case
`LearnAPI.is_static(algorithm) == true`.

# New implementations

If there is no notion of a "target" variable in the LearnAPI.jl sense, or you need an
operation with an inverse, implement [`transform`](@ref) instead.

Implementation is optional. Only the first signature (with or without the `data` argument)
is implemented, but each `kind_of_proxy` that gets an implementation must be added to the
list returned by [`LearnAPI.kinds_of_proxy`](@ref).

If `data` is not present in the implemented signature (eg., for density estimators) then
[`LearnAPI.features(algorithm, data)`](@ref) must return `nothing`.

    transform(model, data)

Return a transformation of some `data`, using some `model`, as returned by
[`fit`](@ref).

# Example

Below, `X` and `Xnew` are data of the same form.

For an `algorithm` that generalizes to new data ("learns"):

```julia
model = fit(algorithm, X; verbosity=0)
transform(model, Xnew)
```

For a static (non-generalizing) transformer:

```julia
model = fit(algorithm)
W = transform(model, X)
```

or, in one step (where supported):

```julia
W = transform(algorithm, X)
```

Note `transform` does not mutate any argument, except in the special case
`LearnAPI.is_static(algorithm) == true`.

    inverse_transform(model, data)

Inverse transform `data` according to some `model` returned by [`fit`](@ref). Here
"inverse" is to be understood broadly, e.g, an approximate
right inverse for [`transform`](@ref).

# Example

In the following, `algorithm` is some dimension-reducing algorithm that generalizes to new
data (such as PCA); `Xtrain` is the training input and `Xnew` the input to be reduced:

```julia
model = fit(algorithm, Xtrain)
W = transform(model, Xnew)       # reduced version of `Xnew`
WÌ‚ = inverse_transform(model, W)  # embedding of `W` in original space
