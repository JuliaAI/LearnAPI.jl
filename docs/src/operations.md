# [Predict and Other Operations](@id operations)

> **Summary** Methods like `predict` and `transform`, that generally depend on learned
> parameters, are called **operations**. All implemented operations must be included in
> the output of the `functions` model trait. When an operation returns a [target
> proxy](@ref scope), it must make a `target_proxies` trait declaration.

An *operation* is any method with signature `some_operation(model, fitted_params,
data...)`. Here `fitted_params` is the learned parameters object, as returned by
[`LearnAPI.fit`](@ref)`(model, ...)`, which will be `nothing` if `fit` is not implemented
(true for models that do not generalize to new data). For example, `LearnAPI.predict` in
the following code snippet is an operation:

```julia
fitted_params, state, fit_report = LearnAPI.fit(some_model, 1, X, y)
ŷ, predict_report = LearnAPI.predict(some_model, fitted_params, Xnew)
```

LearnAPI.jl only provides these operations:

| method                             | compulsory? | fallback | requires    |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
[`LearnAPI.predict`](@ref)           | no          | none     |             |
[`LearnAPI.predict_joint`](@ref)     | no          | none     |             |
[`LearnAPI.transform`](@ref)         | no          | none     |             |
[`LearnAPI.inverse_transform`](@ref) | no          | none     | `transform` |


## General requirements

- Operations always return a tuple `(output, report)` where `output` is the usual output
  (e.g., the target predictions if the operation is `predict`) and `report`
  includes byproducts of the computation, typically `nothing` unless the model does not
  generalize to new data (does not implement `fit`). 

- Only implement `predict_joint` for outputting a *single* multivariate probability
  distribution for multiple input observations, as described further at
  [`LearnAPI.predict_joint`](@ref).

- The name of each operation explicitly overloaded must be included in the return value
  of the [`LearnAPI.functions`](@ref) trait.

## Predict or transform?

- If the model has a target, as defined under [Scope and undefined notions](@ref scope),
  then only `predict` or `predict_joint` can be used to compute a corresponding target
  proxy.

- If an operation is to have an inverse operation, then it cannot be `predict` - use
  `transform` and `inverse_transform`.

- If only a single operation is implemented, and there is no target variable, use
  `transform`.

Here an "inverse" of `transform` is very broadly understood as any operation that can be
applied to the output of `transform` to obtain an object of the same form as the input of
`transform`; for example this includes one-sided inverses, and approximate one-sided
inverses. 


## Target proxies

In the case that a model has the concept of a **target** variable, as described under
[Scope and undefined notions](@ref scope), the output of `predict` may have the form of a
proxy for the target, such as a vector of truth-probabilities for binary targets.

We assume the reader is already familiar with the notion of a target variable in
supervised learning, but target variables are not limited to supervised models. For
example, we may regard the "outlier"/"inlier" assignments in unsupervised anomaly
detection as a target. A target proxy in this example would be probabilities for
outlierness, as these can be paired with "outlier"/"inlier" labels assigned by humans,
using, say, area under the ROC curve, to quantify performance.

Similarly, the integer labels assigned to some observations by a clustering algorithm can
be regarded as a target variable. The labels obtained can be paired with human labels
using, say, the Rand index. 

The kind of proxy one has is informally classified by a subtype of the abstract type
`LearnAPI.TargetProxy`. These types are intended for dispatch outside of LearnAPI.jl and
have no fields (i.e., only one instance). 

In reading the table below, recall that an **observation** is just anything generated by
iterating over the contents of some data object.


|          type                   | form of an observation| 
|:-------------------------------:|:----------------------|
| `LearnAPI.None`                 | has no declared relationship with a target variable |
| `LearnAPI.TrueTarget`           | same as target observations (possible requirement: observations have same type as target observations) |
| `LearnAPI.Sampleable`           | object that can be sampled to obtain object of the same form as target observation (possible requirement: observation implements `Base.rand`) |
| `LearnAPI.Distribution`         | explicit probability density/mass function whose sample space is all possible target observations (possible requirement: observation implements `Distributions.pdf` and `Base.rand`) |
| `LearnAPI.LogDistribution`      | explicit log-probability density/mass function whose sample space is possible target observations (possible requirement: observation implements `Distributions.logpdf` and `Base.rand`) |
|  † `LearnAPI.Probability`       | raw numerical probability or probability vector |
|  † `LearnAPI.LogProbability`    | log-probability or log-probability vector | 
|  † `LearnAPI.Parametric`        | a list of parameters (e.g., mean and variance) describing some distribution |
| `LearnAPI.LabelAmbiguous`            | collections of labels (in case of multi-class target) but without a known correspondence to the original target labels (and of possibly different number) as in, e.g., clustering | 
| `LearnAPI.LabelAmbiguousSampleable`  | sampleable version of `LabelAmbiguous`; see `Sampleable` above  |
| `LearnAPI.LabelAmbiguousDistribution`| pdf/pmf version of `LabelAmbiguous`; see `Distribution`  above  |
| `LearnAPI.ConfidenceInterval`   | confidence interval (possible requirement:  observation `isa Tuple{Real,Real}`) |
| `LearnAPI.Set`                  | finite but possibly varying number of target observations (possible requirement: observation isa `Set{target_observation_type}`) |
| `LearnAPI.ProbabilisticSet`      | as for `Set` but labeled with probabilities (not necessarily summing to one) |
| `LearnAPI.SurvivalFunction`     | survival function (possible requirement: observation is single-argument function mapping `Real` to `Real`) |
| `LearnAPI.SurvivalDistribution` | probability distribution for survival time (possible requirement: observation have type `Distributions.ContinuousUnivariateDistribution`) |

!!! warning

	The "possible requirement"s listed are not part of LearnAPI.jl.

When `predict` outputs a target proxy, there must be [`LearnAPI.predict_proxy`](@ref)
declaration, as in

```julia
LearnAPI.predict_proxy(::Type{<:SomeModel}) = LearnAPI.Distribution()
```

which has the short form

```julia
LearnAPI.@trait predict_proxy = (predict=LearnAPI.Distribution(),)
```

If `predict_joint` is implemented, then an analogous
[`LearnAPI.predict_joint_proxy`](@ref) declaration is required. The output of
`predict_joint` is not a number of observations but a single object, and the trait value
must be an instance of one of the following types:

|          type                   | form of output of `predict_joint(model, fitted_params, data...)`
|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------|
| `LearnAPI.JointSampleable`      | object that can be sampled to obtain a *vector* whose elements have the form of target observations; the vector length matches the number of observations in `data`. |
| `LearnAPI.JointDistribution`    | explicit probability density/mass function whose sample space is vectors of target observations;  the vector length matches the number of observations in `data` |
| `LearnAPI.JointLogDistribution` | explicit log-probability density/mass function whose sample space is vectors of target observations;  the vector length matches the number of observations in `data` |
